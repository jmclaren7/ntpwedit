To compile ntpwedit you will need:

1) This sources :)
2) MINGW compiler (http://www.mingw.org/)
3) Any working PERL interpreter (for openssl build process)
4) OpenSSL 0.9.7d sources (other versions may also work)
   (http://www.openssl.org/)

After you get all parts, do this:

Install MINGW and PERL. Installed executables must be accessible through
PATH environment variable. Copy "mingw32-make.exe" into "make.exe"
(located in mingw "bin" directory).

Unpack OpenSSL sources into ntpwedit directory. After unpacking,
directory openssl-0.9.7d must be present.

Run: openssl.bat
    - openssl library will be compiled

Next run: make release
    - ntpwedit.exe will be compiled and linked
